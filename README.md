# Irish Election Tallies
## The idea
So for the last lots of years I have provided a tally system for Dublin-midwest. This as iterated from static spreadsheets(Excel & LibreOffice) to real time Google sheets. The idea is to create an application that based on a few config files create a real time google sheet of the tally.

# Irish Election Tallies
## The idea
So for the last lots of years I have provided a tally system for [Dublin-midwest](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAXZVwYs_EL9lHf_-zNs_QLe_7iyPcEUr6ctOWXlMx4/edit#gid=1255541632). This has iterated from static spreadsheets(Excel & LibreOffice) to real time Google sheets. The idea is to create an application that based on a few config files create a real time google sheet of the tally of any constituency.


## Notes:
### Getting started with google sheets api.

There is a comprehesive guide [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/go)
